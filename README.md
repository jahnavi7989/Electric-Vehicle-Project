# Electric Vehicles Data Analysis ðŸš—âš¡

This repository contains an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** of electric vehicle (EV) data using **Python**. With the growing trend of sustainable transportation, this project aims to gain insights into EV adoption patterns across different regions. Through statistical and visual exploration, the analysis provides valuable findings on the distribution, trends, and correlations in EV data.

## Motivation
Electric vehicles are becoming a cornerstone of the global transition to clean energy. Governments, companies, and consumers are increasingly shifting towards EVs to reduce carbon emissions and combat climate change. This project was initiated to:
- Understand **regional differences** in EV adoption.
- Identify **correlations and patterns** between metrics like EV counts and geographic factors.
- Provide **insights for stakeholders** (government bodies, EV manufacturers) to enhance EV policies and infrastructure.

## Installation

Make sure Python 3.x is installed on your machine. To install all dependencies, run:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy seaborn matplotlib plotly
```

Or use the following if a `requirements.txt` is included:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Youâ€™ll also need **Jupyter Notebook** to run the analysis interactively:

```bash
pip install notebook
```

---

## Dataset

The analysis is based on a dataset named **`dataset.csv`**, which provides details of electric vehicles at the **state** and **county levels**.  
The key fields include:

- **State**: Name of the U.S. state  
- **County**: Sub-regional unit within each state  
- **EV_Count**: Number of registered EVs in the respective area  
- **Other metrics**: Additional numerical attributes used for correlation analysis  

This dataset is **fictional/sample or real (optional)** based on your description.

1. Data Loading & Cleaning:
   - Load the dataset using `pandas`.
   - Display initial statistics, shape, and check for missing values.

2. Visualization & EDA:
   - Distribution plots: Histograms and KDE plots for numerical data.
   - Outlier detection: Boxplots to detect anomalies.
   - Relationships: Pairplots and correlation heatmaps.
   - Geospatial analysis: Choropleth map using Plotly to visualize EV counts.

---

## Features and Analysis

### 1. Distribution Plots  
- Visualized the spread of EV counts and other metrics using histograms and KDE plots.

### 2. Outlier Detection  
- Boxplots identified counties/states with extremely high or low EV counts, providing insights into regional disparities.

### 3. Correlation Heatmap  
- The correlation matrix shows relationships between variables. Positive and negative correlations are highlighted with a heatmap.

### 4. Geospatial Analysis  
- Choropleth map visualizes the **concentration of EVs** in different states and counties.
- Interactive plots allow users to explore the data with hover functionality.

## Challenges Faced

1. Handling Missing Data: 
   - Some states/counties had missing EV data, requiring **imputation or filtering** strategies.
   
2. Data Visualization Limits: 
   - Large datasets made certain visualizations cluttered; interactive plots were used to address this issue.
   
3. Data Cleaning Complexity: 
   - Cleaning inconsistencies between state and county names to ensure proper grouping for geospatial analysis.



## Results

- Distribution Insight: Most regions had relatively low EV counts, with certain states showing high concentration.
- Geographical Patterns: States with favorable policies and infrastructure had higher EV adoption.
- Outliers Detected: A few counties had disproportionately higher EV numbers, possibly due to local incentives or population density.
- Correlation Insights: Strong correlations between EV adoption and certain geographic/financial factors (if available).


## Future Scope

- Predictive Modeling: Use machine learning models to predict future EV adoption.
- Dashboard Development: Create interactive dashboards with Plotly Dash or Tableau for real-time visualization.
- Policy Recommendations: Provide actionable insights to policymakers based on trends found in the analysis.
- Expansion to Global Data: Incorporate EV data from multiple countries for a more comprehensive view.
